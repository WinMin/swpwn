        📦 setup.py (for humans)
        =======================
        
        This repo exists to provide [an example setup.py] file, that can be used
        to bootstrap your next Python project. It includes some advanced
        patterns and best practices for `setup.py`, as well as some
        commented–out nice–to–haves.
        
        For example, this `setup.py` provides a `$ python setup.py upload`
        command, which creates a *universal wheel* (and *sdist*) and uploads
        your package to [PyPi] using [Twine], without the need for an annoying
        `setup.cfg` file. It also creates/uploads a new git tag, automatically.
        
        In short, `setup.py` files can be daunting to approach, when first
        starting out — even Guido has been heard saying, "everyone cargo cults
        thems". It's true — so, I want this repo to be the best place to
        copy–paste from :)
